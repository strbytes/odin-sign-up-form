# odin-sign-up-form
Sign-Up Form project for The Odin Project

Went a little beyond with the 'show password' checkbox and choosing my own colorscheme but otherwise stuck to the project guidelines. Couldn't figure out how to get the focus on the checkbox to display properly so it's kind of ugly but otherwise I'm happy with how this came out. :)
